# Auto Searching on YouTube using Selenium

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use Selenium to perform auto searching on YouTube. The project is implemented from scratch in Python in a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`).

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Selenium
- WebDriver for your preferred web browser (e.g. ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
- pip install selenium

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new Python file.
2. Import the Selenium library.
3. Download the WebDriver for your preferred web browser and add its path to your environment variables.
4. Launch the web browser using the WebDriver.
5. Navigate to the YouTube website.
6. Find the search bar and send keys to enter the desired search query.
7. Submit the search query.
8. Perform any desired actions on the search results, such as clicking on a specific video.

## Conclusion
With Selenium, you can easily automate searching on YouTube and perform various actions on the search results. This can be useful for various purposes, such as data scraping or automating repetitive tasks.
